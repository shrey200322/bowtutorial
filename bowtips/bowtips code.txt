Do you need a recurve bow for target practice or hunting? Well, any bow can be used for target practice. However, when it comes to hunting, there are numerous parameters that you must consider. And one of the main parameters is the draw weight of your bow. Draw weight is the force you must apply on the string to pull it over a distance of about 28 inches. Powerful recurve bows have very high draw weights since they have to penetrate big game’s skin and fat tissue. Over at shootingandsafety.com, you can find the best recurve bows for beginners but also for experienced archers.

After determining the draw weight of your bow, you need to consider the actual weight of your weapon. Remember, you will be holding it in front of you when shooting for an extended period; therefore, your bow’s actual weight is essential. The weight of most recurve bows ranges between 2 pounds and 3.5 pounds. So, look for something that feels comfortable in your hands.

The length of your ideal bow should be more than twice your draw length. That means, if your draw length is 28 inches, your bow must be over 56 inches long. Remember, the longer the bow, the more accurate it will be.

2.Focus on Proper Stance

The way you stand when shooting a recurve bow plays a key role in the accuracy of your shots. Shooting a recurve arrow is more than just standing there, aiming, and releasing the arrow. It is an art that requires the right stance. Therefore, your feet must be in the same place every time, with your upper body being supported by the lower body. Plus, you should never lean on anyone or anything. Some of the most common stances for beginners are:

Open stance-This stance involves you turning your hips and feet slightly towards your target.
Square stance– With this stance, your feet should be parallel to your shooting line
The simplest stance to master is the square stance, since it facilitates a great biomechanical alignment, by merely placing your shoulders and hips in line with your target. Open stance can be quite challenging to perfect, and if not done well, your shoulders and hips will be misaligned, resulting in the weight of your bow being distributed unevenly. And this will affect your balance.

When using this bow, your shoulders must be in a straight line. This way, your shoulders can support your bow’s weight. You should never under extend or overextend your front shoulder. And your back shoulder should be aligned to the front shoulder. In fact, your upper body should form a nice “T” when your string is drawn. Make sure the shoulders are straight, relaxed, and low, with the ribcage over the hips. A right posture can help you align your upper body.

4.Look for a Great Anchor Point

Another major thing every beginner must find is their anchor point. The anchor point refers to the place where you will rest your draw hand when you pull the string back. For most beginners, the best anchor point is when your index finger rests on the corner of your mouth. The anchor point should always be firm. It should never be forceful, and your hand should always rest there every time you draw your bowstring.

For experienced archers, the index finger of the drawing hand is usually anchored under their jaws. Your anchor point should be on the same spot every time you pull the bowstring, both in terms of the distance back or forward and height of the jaw/face. A change in the anchor spot can result in your arrow missing the target.

The moment you release your arrow is usually freeing, fun, and a test of your skills. Therefore, before you do this, think about a technique that can minimize the movement of the bowstring back-and-forth after being released. You can reduce the movement by pulling the string through the release instead of just opening the fingers. For a great release, focus on how the string is trying to push your fingers out of the way and pull the draw elbow back. And instead of following the arrow when you release it, keep your eyes at the target.
